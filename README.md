# EDA_IRIS_DATASET
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris dataset involves examining the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data to uncover patterns across three iris species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By visualizing features like petal and sepal dimensions, this analysis helps identify the most distinguishing character.
# 🌸 Iris Dataset EDA Project

This project dives deep into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset, showcasing how simple statistical techniques and visualizations can reveal patterns in the data. The Iris dataset contains measurements for three flower species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on petal and sepal dimensions.

## 🔍 Objective
Gain insights into the structure and distribution of the dataset, understand relationships between features, and detect patterns that distinguish different species.

## 📊 Features Explored
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species** classification

## 📈 Visualizations Used
- Histograms and box plots for univariate analysis
- Pair plots and scatter plots for feature relationships
- Correlation heatmaps
- Violin plots to compare feature distributions across species

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch `EDA_Iris.ipynb` and follow along with the analysis

## 📌 Insights
- Petal measurements are the most effective in separating species.
- Setosa shows distinct patterns, while Versicolor and Virginica are more closely related.
- Feature distributions vary significantly across species, useful for classification tasks.
